            <li>I taught myself HTML5, C++ and Java in high school and built a computer with some friends, sourcing our parts from NewEgg.com!</li>
            <li>Since then, I've continued coding as a hobby and have now begun pursuing a career through Thinkful's education program.</li>

            <li>I moved to Chicago in 2015 and began working with a local roaster. Eventually my work led to working on equipment through Steamvolt, a lab run by the finest coffee technicians.</li>
            <li>I've always had a passion for technology and was raised in technical work on small appliances,which eventually led me to become an espresso technician for four years.</li>
            <li>My path has now led back to programming. I'm excited to help build your online presence through this course with Thinkful!</li>
