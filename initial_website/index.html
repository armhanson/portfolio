          <li>After high school, I put my interest in music to use and obtained my Associates of Fine Arts: Music. I was involved in my hometown with a couple music projects.</li>
          <li>I moved on to the coffee industry in 2015 in Chicago, working with a local roaster and eventually began working on the equipment through the local techinician's lab, Steamvolt.</li>
